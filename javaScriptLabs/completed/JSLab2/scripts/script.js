/* Example
This is a variable declaration. 
Also referred to as a variable definition.
It typically will have a keyword and then the name 
of the variable. In this case, the variable is named 
firstVariable. The keyword let indicates to JavaScript
that we are defining a new variable.*/

 Here we initialize firstVariable

 Notice that to use our variable we don't need to

 the variable.*/
